            <p> United Nations is an international organization founded in 1945. Currently made up of 193 Member States,
                the UN and
                its work are guided by the purposes and principles contained in its founding Charter.
                The UN has evolved over the years to keep pace with a rapidly changing world.
                But one thing has stayed the same: it remains the one place on Earth where all the world's nations can
                gather together,
                discuss common problems, and find shared solutions that benefit all of humanity. The Secretary-General
                is Chief
                Administrative Officer of the UN - and is also a symbol of the Organization's ideals and an advocate for
                all the world's
                peoples, especially the poor and vulnerable.</p>

            <p>The Secretary-General is appointed by the General Assembly on the recommendation of the Security Council
                for a 5-year,
                renewable term.
                The current Secretary-General, and the 9th occupant of the post, is António Guterres of Portugal, who
                took office on 1
                January 2017.
                On the 18th of June, 2021, Guterres was re-appointed to a second term, pledging as his priority to
                continue helping the
                world chart a course out of the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>

                <p>The service at the Hotel Monteleone was exceptional. There was absolutely no issue that was not
                    addressed timely and
                    with satisfactory results. We were particulary impressed with how the hotel staff anticipated our
                    needs (periodically
                    coming by the Board Room to check with us)</p>
